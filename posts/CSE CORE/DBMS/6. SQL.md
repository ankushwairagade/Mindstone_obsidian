#### What is SQL?
**SQL** is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. SQL can be used to insert, search, update, and delete database records. SQL can do lots of other operations, including optimizing and maintenance of databases.


#### What is SQL used for?
Here are important reasons for using SQL

-   It helps users to access data in the RDBMS system.
-   It helps you to describe the data.
-   It allows you to define the data in a database and manipulate that specific data.
-   With the help of SQL, you can create and drop databases and tables.
-   SQL offers you to use the function in a database, create a view, and stored procedure.
-   You can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views.


#### Types of SQL Statements
Here are five types of widely used SQL queries.

-   Data Definition Language (DDL)
-   Data Manipulation Language (DML)
-   Data Control Language (DCL)
-   Transaction Control Language (TCL)
-   Data Query Language (DQL)



#### SQL Process
When you want to execute an SQL command for any DBMS system, you need to find the best method to carry out your request, and SQL engine determines how to interpret that specific task.

Important components included in this SQL process are:

-   SQL Query Engine
-   Optimization Engines
-   Query Dispatcher
-   Classic Query Engine

A classic query engine allows you to manage all the non-SQL queries.

#### What is a database in SQL?
A [database](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-database-sql.html) is made up of a collection of tables that stores a detailed set of structured data. It is a table that contains a collection of rows, referred to as records or tuples, and columns that are also referred to as attributes.

Each column in the table is designed to store a specific type of information, for example, names, dates, dollar amounts, and numbers.


#### What is NoSQL?

**NoSQL** is an upcoming category of [Database Management Systems](https://www.guru99.com/what-is-dbms.html). Its main characteristic is its non-adherence to Relational Database Concepts. NoSQL means “Not only SQL”. The concept of NoSQL databases grew with internet giants such as Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. who deal with gigantic volumes of data.

When you use a relational database for massive volumes of data, the system starts getting slow in terms of response time. To overcome this, we could “scale up” our systems by upgrading our existing hardware. The alternative to the above problem would be to distribute our database load on multiple hosts as the load increases. This is known as “scaling out”.

NoSQL database is **non-relational databases** that scale-out better than relational databases and are designed with web applications in mind. They do not use SQL to query the data and do not follow strict schemas like relational models. With NoSQL, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) features are not guaranteed always.

# SQL BASICS

#### how to start sql using terminal ###

sudo mysql -u root -p    // Linux
		./mysql -u root -p  // Windows
		

To see Existing Database
	-> show databases ;
To create Database
	-> create database database_name ;
To select Database 
	-> use database_name ;

Syntax to create Table

CREATE  TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] `TableName` (`fieldname` dataType [optional parameters]) ENGINE = storage Engine;

#### DATA TYPES
Data types define the nature of the data that can be stored in a particular column of a table

MySQL has **3** main categories of data types namely

1.  Numeric -> int(), tinyint(), smallint(), float(), double(,), decimal(,)
2.  Text  -> char(), varchar(), longtext,...
3.  Date/time.  -> Date , datetime , timestamp , time ....

Other Datatypes are
Enum ,Set , Bool , Binary, Varbinary .

### MySQL SELECT Statement

SELECT QUERY is used to fetch the data from the MySQL database. Databases store data for later retrieval. The purpose of MySQL Select is to return from the database tables, one or more rows that match a given criteria. Select query can be used in scripting language like PHP, Ruby, or you can execute it 

##### SQL SELECT statement syntax

It is the most frequently used SQL command and has the following general syntax

SELECT [DISTINCT|ALL ] { * | [fieldExpression [AS newName]} FROM tableName [alias] [WHERE condition][GROUP BY fieldName(s)]  [HAVING condition] ORDER BY fieldName(s)

____
#### What is WHERE Clause in MYSQL?
**WHERE Clause** in MySQL is a keyword used to specify the exact criteria of data or rows that will be affected by the specified SQL statement. The WHERE clause can be used with SQL statements like INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, and DELETE to filter records and perform various operations on the data.


##### WHERE clause Syntax

The basic syntax for the WHERE clause when used in a MySQL SELECT WHERE statement is as follows.

SELECT * FROM tableName WHERE condition;

_____

#### What is INSERT INTO?

**INSERT INTO** is used to store data in the tables. The INSERT command creates a new row in the table to store data. The data is usually supplied by application programs that run on top of the database.

#### Basic syntax

Let’s look at the basic syntax of the INSERT INTO MySQL command:

INSERT INTO `table_name`(column_1,column_2,...) VALUES (value_1,value_2,...);

___

#### What is the DELETE Query?

**MySQL Delete** command is used to delete rows that are no longer required from the database tables. It deletes the whole row from the table and returns count of deleted rows. Delete command comes in handy to delete temporary or obsolete data from your database.


##### How to Delete a row in MySQL

To delete a row in MySQL, the DELETE FROM statement is used:

DELETE FROM `table_name` [WHERE condition];


----

##### What is the UPDATE Query?

**UPDATE MySQL** command is used to modify rows in a table. The update command can be used to update a single field or multiple fields at the same time. It can also be used to update a MySQL table with values from another table.


##### MySQL Update Command Syntax

The basic syntax of the Update query in MySQL is as shown below.

UPDATE `table_name` SET `column_name` = `new_value' [WHERE condition];
